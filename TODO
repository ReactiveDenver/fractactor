TODO

o use lift to expose the calculator as a restful service

o when rendering to the screen, first few scanlines are sometimes not 
  rendered. probably a timing issue between the creation of the 
  graphics context vs the arrival of first computed pixels

o add general logging

o add some partial functions

o parallelize with remote actors

General Information

  fractactor is a fractal generating engine implemented in scala. It uses
  actors and asynchronous messaging to achieve a high degree of 
  parallelism and traits to layer in compute functions and rendering 
  strategies.

  The purpose of this project is to utilize some of the key features of
  the scala programming language to build an elegant, highly parallel, 
  and modular solution for calculating functions, such as the Mandelbrot set,
  in the complex plane.

  This project isn't the fastest Mandelbrot set generator ever written.
  And, it certainly isn't the most feature rich. 

  It does, however, attempt to take advantage of some of scala's interesting 
  features:

    0. Overloaded operators - complex operations, e.g. Complex: z = z*z + c
    1. Pattern matching - e.g. FractalGenerator, renderer/function selection
    2. Actors - parallelism and asynchronous messaging, e.g. FractalPeer
    3. Traits - rendering and calculation, e.g. HolomorphicFunction, Renderer
    4. Mixins - compound composition, e.g. MandelbrotGenerator


Usage

  % scripts/fractactor.sh

  Scala actor-based fractal engine.

  Usage: FractalGenerator type render mode iter w h rmin imin rmax imax [file]

  e.g. To generate the Mandelbrot set, using 1 actor per pixel, to a file:
    FractalGenerator mandelbrot file pixels 256 512 512 -1.5 -1.5 1.5 1.5 x.jpg

  e.g. To generate the Mandelbrot set, w/ 1 actor per scanline, to the screen:
    FractalGenerator mandelbrot screen pixels 256 512 512 -1.5 -1.5 1.5 1.5

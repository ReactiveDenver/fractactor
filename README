General Information

  fractactor is an actor-based fractal generator implemented in scala.

  The purpose of this project is to utilize some of the key features of
  the scala programming language to build an elegant, highly parallel, 
  and modular solution for computing functions, such as the mandelbrot set,
  in the complex plane.

  This project isn't the fastest Mandelbrot set generator ever written.
  And, it certainly isn't the most feature rich. 

  It does, however, attempt to illustrate some of scala's most interesting 
  features.

    0. Overloaded operators - complex operations, e.g. Complex: z = z*z + c
    1. Actors - parallelism and asynchronous messaging, e.g. FractalPeer
    2. Traits - rendering and calculation, e.g. HolomorphicFunction, Renderer
    3. Mixins - compound composition, e.g. MandelbrotGenerator


Usage

  % scripts/fractactor.sh

  Scala actor-based Mandelbrot set generator.
  To generate to the UI rather than file, specify "screen" for file option

  Usage: MandelbrotGenerator file iter width height rmin imin rmax imax [pixels]
    e.g. MandelbrotGenerator image.jpg 256 512 512 -1.5 -1.5 1.5 1.5 pixels

Classes

  Calculation
    HolomorphicFunction [trait] - a generic function in the complex plane
      MandelbrotFunction [trait] - the Mandelbrot function

  Rendering
    Renderer [trait] - an interface for rendering pixels
      ScreenRenderer - Renderer, with a screen implementation
      FileRenderer - Renderer, with a JPG file implementation
    RenderPanel - Java/Swing panel w/ support for plotting pixels or scanlines

  Fractal Generation
    Settings - general system settings
    ImageAssembler - converts cartesian screen points into calculation requests
    FractalCalculator - (actor) receives & responds to calculation requests
    FractalPeer - (actor) receives results and dispatches them to the renderer

  Console/UI Application
    MandelbrotGenerator - generator composed from assembler/calculator/peer

  Tests
    MandelbrotClient - console to test point calculation and messaging


Performance

  512x512, 256 threshold
    using synchronous calc calls, no actors: 1.956s to 2.197s

  async, with "!"
    using 1 actor per pixel: 4.389s
    using 1 actor per scanline: 2.024s

  async, with "!!"
    to disk: 1 actor per scanline: 1.414s
    to screen: 1 actor per scanline: 2.472s
    to screen: 1 actor per pixel: 11.960s

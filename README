General Information

  fractactor is a fractal generator implemented in scala. It uses
  actors and asynchronous messaging to achieve a high degree of 
  parallelism and traits to layer in compute functions and rendering 
  strategies.

  The purpose of this project is to utilize some of the key features of
  the scala programming language to build an elegant, highly parallel, 
  and modular solution for calculating functions, such as the mandelbrot set,
  in the complex plane.

  This project isn't the fastest Mandelbrot set generator ever written.
  And, it certainly isn't the most feature rich. 

  It does, however, attempt to take advantage of some of scala's interesting 
  features:

    0. Overloaded operators - complex operations, e.g. Complex: z = z*z + c
    1. Actors - parallelism and asynchronous messaging, e.g. FractalPeer
    2. Traits - rendering and calculation, e.g. HolomorphicFunction, Renderer
    3. Mixins - compound composition, e.g. MandelbrotGenerator


Usage

  % scripts/fractactor.sh

  Scala actor-based Mandelbrot set generator.
  To generate to the UI rather than file, specify "screen" for file option

  Usage: MandelbrotGenerator file iter width height rmin imin rmax imax [pixels]
    e.g. MandelbrotGenerator image.jpg 256 512 512 -1.5 -1.5 1.5 1.5 pixels

Classes

  Calculation
    HolomorphicFunction [trait] - a generic function in the complex plane
      MandelbrotFunction [trait] - the Mandelbrot function

  Rendering
    Renderer [trait] - an interface for rendering pixels
      ScreenRenderer - Renderer, with a screen implementation
      FileRenderer - Renderer, with a JPG file implementation
    RenderPanel - Java/Swing panel w/ support for plotting pixels or scanlines

  Fractal Generation
    Settings - general system settings
    ImageAssembler - converts cartesian screen points into calculation requests
    FractalCalculator - (actor) receives & responds to calculation requests
    FractalPeer - (actor) receives results and dispatches them to the renderer

  Console/UI Application
    MandelbrotGenerator - generator composed from assembler/calculator/peer

  Tests
    MandelbrotClient - console to test point calculation and messaging
